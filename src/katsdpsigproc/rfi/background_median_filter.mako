 *
 * Applies a median filter to each channel. Each workgroup processes a
 * section of one channel and multiple baselines. At present, each
 * channel is handled by separate threads from possibly several
 * workgroups, although it may be beneficial to group some of those
 * threads into the same workground purely for occupancy reasons. Each
 * thread has significant startup overhead in this implementation, so
 * there is a balance between using more threads for greater parallelism
 * vs fewer threads for reduced overhead.
 *
 * Each thread processes a contiguous part of the band for a baseline, using
 * a sliding-window median filter.
 *
 * Optionally, per-channel flags can be passed in, indicating known-bad values
 * that should be ignored for computing the background. Any non-zero flag value
 * indicates that the corresponding visibility should be ignored.
 *
 * If is_amplitude is true, then the inputs are the amplitudes rather than
 * complex values. In this case, negative values are also treated as flagged,
 * regardless of whether flag booleans are provided.
 *
 * The output is the difference between the original and filtered amplitudes.
 * Flagged values in the input are mapped to zero in the output.
