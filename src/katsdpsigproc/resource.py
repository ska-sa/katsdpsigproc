    There are two ways to make the acquisition current:

     1. Call :meth:`wait`, which returns a future. The result of this future
        is a list of device events that must complete before it is safe to use
        the resource; they can either be waited for on the host (for example,
        using ``run_in_executor``), or by enqueuing a device wait before
        device operations on the resource.
     2. The above steps (with a blocking host wait) can be combined using
        :meth:`wait_events`.

    Instances of this class should never be constructed directly. Instead, use
    :meth:`Resource.acquire`.

    This class implements the context manager protocol, providing the
    underlying resource as the return value. This handles some cleanup if the
    method using the resource raises an exception without releasing the
    resource cleanly.
